# Delete WhatsApp

## Note: WhatsApp cannot delete your account for you at this time

OK. This is a strange one. To delete your WhatsApp account seems straight forward:

1. Open WhatsApp

2. Go to **Settings > Account > Delete My Account**.

3. Enter your full phone number and tap **Delete My Account**.

That's it. This should be the point where you get a hug â€” but. WhatsApp have a strange message on their support pages that says **Note: We cannot delete your account for you at this time** ðŸ¤”

We can't figure out if this is just confusing contentâ€”for example, they can't delete accounts on the user's behalfâ€”or if they *actually* can't delete accounts. We're trying to find out more. Will update soon.
