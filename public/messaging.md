# Encrypted messaging

## End-to-end encryption is the ‚Äúfeature‚Äù you're looking for

[WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/) has end-to-end encryption which gets a big thumbs up üëç. This means that the content of your messages can only be seen by you‚Äîthe sender‚Äîand the person(s) you send it to. The content can't be seen by WhatsApp. However, they can see all the metadata. Metadata means things like:

- Where you use the app
- When you use the app
- Who you send messages to
- What time you send messages
- The amount of messages
- The type of message (text, image, video, GIF)
- Etc, etc

And, because it's WhatsApp and they're part of the Facebook Group, guess who they share their data with. That's right.

Try these alternatives:
- [Wire](https://wire.com/en/) is also meant to be super secure and looks to be more aimed at the work environment.
- [Signal](https://signal.org) is meant to be the most secure.
- [Antidote](https://antidote.im) for iOS and [Antox](https://github.com/Antox/Antox) for Android are clients for [Tox](https://tox.chat) which is a free and Open Source messaging project that is encrypted and distributed to keep all your conversations safe.
- ~~[Telegram](https://telegram.org) uses end-to-end encryption but apparently it's their own special flavour and has some flaws.~~ We no longer recommend Telegram.
