# Focused browsing

## Do not track

You can go to extremes in this area with Virtual Private Networks which we may dig into in the future. For the average person just changing your default browser is a baby step in the right direction.

Try these alternatives:

- [Brave](https://brave.com) is a great browser that blocks trackers. These are things that the big data hoarders use to find out more about you. Stopping them gives them less of your data but check this out: it also makes loading websites faster because these horrible tracker things take time to download. Stopping trackers is awesome!
- [Firefox Focus](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/focus) on mobile is brilliant. It too has all the tracker stopping magic but in addition to that it is ingenious in it's lack of a feature: it has no tabs. Tab clutter can be a real problem and a distraction. Sometimes you keep tabs open out of bad habit or because you think you'll come back to it later. Firefox Focus helps kill this habit. If that specific tab truly is important, you'll remember it later.

Whether you use either of the browsers above you should switch your default search engine to [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/). DuckDuckGo doesn't store any data about your search habits and you soon get used to the fact that it's not Google.

That's it. No more Chrome. No more Safari. No more tracking.
