Privacy is becoming a bigger and bigger concern. These days you don’t have to look far to find negative news on the likes of Facebook, Google and other tech giants; collecting the most extensive data sets ever assembled on human social behaviour for the sole purpose of advertising to us.

Consider:
- how many online products have you signed up to?
- how many companies have you handed personal data to?
- how many permissions have you granted?
- how many privacy policies haven't you read?

**Be a Deletist**, contains the **Top 10 Delete Hit List** including Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Twitter and more. These lists include guides on how to be safer online, permanently delete your data and alternatives to try.

People are becoming self-aware but most find it hard to let go. The advice and guides on **Be a Deletist** along with the motivational newsletter you can sign up for will help people on their path to deletism: reducing digital clutter and making more time for things that matter.

It's no longer safe to be ignorant to this social norm of exchanging your data for the “free” use of products. It's time to reduce your digital footprint and take back control of *your* data.
