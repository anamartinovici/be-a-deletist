# Delete Instagram

## How to download your data?

**You can't. Yet.**

Instagram doesn't provide a way for you to download your photos and data but [they are working on one](https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/11/download-your-instagram-photos/).

We are aware there are third-party apps that say they can do this in the meantime such as InstaPort but we've never managed to get it to work in our testing and you shouldn't have to authorise another app â€”Â potentially handing over more data to yet another company â€” to download your data.

We'll update you with new info once Instagram releases their own tool. Until then **we don't recommend deleting your account** because you will lose everything.

## Ready to permanently delete Instagram?

**This is not recommended until you've downloaded your photos and data.**

To permanently delete your account:

1. You will need to log into Instagram on the web. You can't delete your account from within the Instagram app.

2. Instagram don't provide a link to the **Delete Your Account** page in your settings. You can access the page via [https://www.instagram.com/accounts/remove/request/permanent/](https://www.instagram.com/accounts/remove/request/permanent/).

3. Select an option from the drop-down menu next to **Why are you deleting your account?** and re-enter your password.

4. Click or tap **Permanently delete my account**.

5. Click or tap **OK** from the final confirmation pop-up.

6. You're done. Have a hug ðŸ¤—
