## How to delete your account

Deleting your account won't delete your posts or comments. If you want to do this you'll have to do it manually. **Once you delete your account you will not be able to go back and delete your posts or comments.**

1.  Go to **Your profile** and click **Delete** on every post.

2. Go to [https://www.reddit.com/prefs/deactivate/](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/deactivate/)

3. Fill out the form and click **Deactivate account**

4. You're done. Have a hug ðŸ¤—
